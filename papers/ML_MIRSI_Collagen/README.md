## ðŸ”¬ Summary
This study presents a **machine learning-assisted multimodal imaging method** combining **mid-infrared spectral imaging (MIRSI)** and **second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy** to identify **fibrillar collagen** in biological tissues. The model achieves:
- **80% boundary F-score** in collagen segmentation
- **0.82 Pearsonâ€™s correlation** in collagen orientation

## ðŸ§¬ Scientific background
Collagen morphology is cancerous tissues changes as cancer progresses. This is the so called tumor associated collagen signature (TACS), which plays an important role in cancer progression, 
and can be used as a biomarker to determine cancer stages. 
MIRSI is a relatively new imaging technique that can provide chemical signal of sample. In this study, we do imaging of tissues using MIRSI to do a preliminary study of the chemical signal of collagen.
For this, the collagen spectra needs to be labelled to differentiate collagen from non-collagen. The ground truth label comes from SHG image of the identical tissue. Given that the chemical spectra is complex and multidimensional, 
we used Random Forest to identify key differentatiors between collagen and non-collagen and interpret the results. 

The overview of this study is illustrated in the following figure.![overview](figures/fig1.png)

## Data preprocessing
An example of MIRSI data is shown in the following figure.

The spectra is pre-processed using PCA for noise reduction, where PCA was performed and reprojected back to the original basis, but only including the first 40 principal components.

SHG data acquired using identical tissue samples are used to label the spectra to differentiate collagen from non-collagen. 
Because they were acquired using different optical setups, they have different specifications and need to be co-registered. 
The registration is done using [a registration method from MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/find-image-rotation-and-scale.html) 
and is done by determining the inverse affine transform given a set of paired landmarks. The set of paired landmarks are chosen manually.

## Training the random forest 
Once the spectra of collagen and non-collagen are obtained, the random forest algorithm can be trained. Here the TreeBagger class from MATLAB was used. The parameters used can be found in the code. 

```
code\trainRF.mlx
```
Once trained, the RF model is used to calculate the probability of collagen for each MIRSI spectra from the validation set. The spectra is then assigned a probability of how likely it is to come from a collagen. 
We used a threshold of >50% to determine whether a spectra contains a collagen or not. This approach produces a lot of noise, but we are including the maximum amount of collagen. After the collagen determination has 
been done to all pixels, essentially we have generated a collagen distribution image from the MIRSI data. The noisy collagen data that is not coming from a larger mass (e.g. a fiber) is omitted,
 because we are focusing on fibrillar collagen. 

An example of the final result is as illustrated in the following figure.
