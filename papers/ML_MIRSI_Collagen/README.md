## ðŸ”¬ Summary
This study presents a **machine learning-assisted multimodal imaging method** combining **mid-infrared spectral imaging (MIRSI)** and **second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy** to identify **fibrillar collagen** in biological tissues. The model achieves:
- **80% boundary F-score** in collagen segmentation
- **0.82 Pearsonâ€™s correlation** in collagen orientation

## ðŸ§¬ Scientific Background
Collagen morphology, the so called tumor associated collagen signature (TACS), plays an important role and can be used as a biomarker for various cancer types at various stages. 
MIRSI is a relatively new imaging technique that can provide chemical signal of sample. In this study, we do imaging of tissues using MIRSI. Subsequently, the spectra is labelled to differentiate collagen from non-collagen. 
The ground truth label comes from SHG image of the identical tissue. The overview of this study is illustrated in ![overview](figures/fig1.png)
